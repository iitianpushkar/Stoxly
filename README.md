## üü¶ Stoxly
Tokenization of every US Stock ‚Äî at the intersection of Blockchain and AI

## üß© Problem
Investing in U.S. stocks using crypto remains inaccessible for most global users. Current systems are either centralized or geographically restricted, preventing seamless participation from crypto-native users.
Furthermore, no system exists that bridges on-chain capital with real-time stock market execution in a decentralized, programmable, and intelligent way
There's also a lack of autonomous agents capable of execution of on-chain actions on behalf of users.

## üí° Solution

**Stoxly** enables crypto users to purchase tokenized U.S. stocks through a single token model (`DSTOCK`), using AVAX on Avalanche Fuji and stablecoin like USDC across multiple chains.
Each user‚Äôs stock purchases are recorded in a verifiable on-chain ledger, enabling transparency and ownership without intermediaries. By leveraging Chainlink Functions, Stoxly fetches real-time stock prices and AVAX/USD conversion rates to ensure fair token issuance and redemptions.
An AI agent powered by **ElizaOS** serves as the user interface, allowing users to chat with their wallet, check holdings, and initiate mint or redeem operations‚Äîall without using a traditional frontend.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### üü¢ Mint Flow

1. User chats with the ElizaOS agent:  
   _"Buy 3 shares of AAPL using 100 AVAX"_

2. Agent calls the mint function of the `dstock` smart contract on Avalanche Fuji.

3. On-chain logic via Chainlink Functions:
   - Fetches real-time **stock price (e.g., AAPL)** in USD
   - Fetches **AVAX/USD price** from Chainlink Price Feed

4. Contract logic:
   ```solidity
   if (avax_in_usd >= stock_price_usd * quantity) {
       mint DSTOCK token(s)
       update totalHoldings[requester][stock]
       refund excess AVAX
   }
### üî¥ Redeem Flow

1. User chats with the agent:
   _"Redeem 2 shares of TSLA"_

2. Agent calls the redeem function of the `dstock` smart contract.

3. On-chain logic via Chainlink Functions:
   - Fetches real-time stock price in USD
   - Uses Chainlink Price Feed for AVAX/USD

4. Contract logic:
   ```solidity
   if (totalHoldings[requester][stock] >= quantity) {
    burn DSTOCK token(s)
    update totalHoldings
    send back equivalent AVAX
   }  

### üåê Cross-Chain Flow (Sepolia ‚Üí Avalanche Fuji)
1. User on a different chain (e.g., Sepolia) wants to mint/redeem a stock using USDC.

2. Agent interacts with Sender Contract on the source chain.

3. Sender Contract sends USDC + metadata (stock, qty, requester) to Avalanche Fuji via Chainlink CCIP.

4. Receiver Contract on Avalanche Fuji forwards data to the DSTOCK contract.

5. DSTOCK contract completes mint/redeem operation as usual.
